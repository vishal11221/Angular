    Note:- Html file, we called as Template file and ts file we called as Class file.
    Note:- if we bind the input area to form then must define ngModel 


    Interview-Question 
     1.If we not declare name of input fields then what happen ?
       It give an error because ngModel accept the value of input field with their name 

     2.If our submit button outside from Form tag then it work ?
