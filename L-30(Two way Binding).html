      Update and display the value at a time,like we take input box and in input box we write something in that and that value also update and display on the screen at a time.
    2.Any other way to Update and display the value at a time ?
      Yes,it is possible but lengthy process,we change the value as onchange event and declare a Function for it then in Function update and display the value.
    3.In that,What is property and Binding ?
      Property is the value like name,email and Binding that means we bind the property value with ngModel.
