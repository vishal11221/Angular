    Note:-Always create a services in specific folder because when we create service directly in our project then it added directly but when you have many services then not easy to find which service has what work.

    <p>In this lecture,we study:- 
        First we create a Service that name is users and return some usersdetails then that service we display on app.componenet.html and Footer componenet,that means we learn how to create one service and display in more than one componenet.
