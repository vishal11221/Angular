    <p>What is Dynamic-Routing in Angular ?
        Dynamic Routing means, that the route configuration of a module can vary at each load depending on the logic you define for the loading. The main trick is to use the ROUTES InjectionToken which is a low-level API for the router configuration.

    <p>Why we use Dynamic-Routing in Angular ?
        They allow us to load components dynamically at runtime depending on some custom logic without having to create a component that is bloated with loads of ngIf's.
