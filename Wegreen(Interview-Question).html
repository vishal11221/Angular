    <ol>
        <li>Introduce yourself</li>
        <li>In Angular,If we have no relationship between component then how we set relationship between component:- Using a Shared Service with Observables (Recommended)
            Create a shared service to act as a bridge between the components.
            Use Subject or BehaviorSubject to create observables that allow components to subscribe to and send data to each other.</li>

        <li>Why we use http in Angular:- In Angular, we use the HttpClient module (which is part of the @angular/common/http package) to interact with external APIs or services. This enables our application to communicate with remote servers to send and receive data.</li>

        <li>What is RouterGuard:- RouterGuard is a service that allows you to control access to specific routes in your Angular application.</li>

        <li>What is HTTP Client:- HTTP Client is a module in Angular that allows you to make HTTP requests to a server.</li>

        <li>How to change paragraph color based on button click:- Use ngStyle property to change the color of the paragraph when the button is clicked. <ol>
            <li>
                 <!-- app.component.html -->
                <p [ngStyle]="{'color': isActive ? 'green' : 'red'}">This text changes color based on isActive.</p>
                <button (click)="isActive = !isActive">{{isActive ? 'red' : 'green'}}</button>

                app.component.ts
                export class AppComponent {
                  isActive = true;
                }
            </li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>How to set routes:- <ol>
            <li>Create component folder in src/app then create 4 components in it.</li>
            <li>Set route in app.module.ts</li>
            <li>Declare it in app.component.html</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>What is Services in Angular:- Services is a class or piece of code that we reuse in more than one component to show data.</li>
        <li>What is subject in Angular:- Subject is an Observable that allows you to share data between components.</li>
