<body>
    <p>We declare Interpolation with double curley-braces and Property-Binding with Array-brackets.Interpolation only accept string and Number value.It not accept boolean value. </p>
    
    <p>Property-binding is used to change the attribute value of tag.Propery-binding accept the boolean value also.</p>

    Note:- Better use is Property-binding instead of Interpolation because it accept string,number,boolean value also.
