    <p>Lazy-Loading:-It is a mechanisms that help to fast your website.It only load that component that need to load other component it avoid.For example we want only user-course page no need other page then it load only course page and avoid other page.</p>

    
    <p>
        For a small application this would be okay. But as the application grows the load time will increase if everything is loaded at once. Lazy loading allows Angular to load only that components and modules when they're needed to load.Lazy loading load only required component and module and rest are it ignore so our website work fast.
    </p>

    Note:- When we work on lazy loading then not import directly our main module admin.module.ts in app.module.ts
