    <p>Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions to use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each pipe once.</p>

       We have many alternative options are there but it take more time to solve,so we use pipes to solve that problem because it take very less time to solve.

     2.Can we use two pipes at a time ?
