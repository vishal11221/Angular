    Interview-Question :- 
    1.What is Service and Why we use it ?
      Services is a class or piece of code that we reuse in more than one component to show data.
      For example:-We have student data that alrady show in Header component, so user also want that same user data also show in Footer component
    2.Give one problem statement where you use service ?
       Services avoid rewriting of code. A service can be written once and injected into all the components that use the service.
       A service could be a function, variable, or feature that an application needs.
