    <title>Interpolation</title>

<body>
    <p>When we use double curley braces with any content,then this is also called Interpolation.Like in previous example we use title in double curley braces with h1. this behaviour also called interpolation</p>
    <p>app.component.ts file contain dynamic data,In this file we have title,Array object data,object data,function data that's why we called that file as dynamic and we use these file data with the help of Interpoloation.
    </p>
    <p>We can do arthemetic operations in interpolation,like {{2+2}},we can match the existing data with the help of interpolation.</p>
    <p>We cannot declare title value in Interpolation,We not check the datatype of variable in Interpolation.We not use increment operator inside interpolation,We not use new keyword inside interpolation</p>
    <p>We can add classname as:-Interpolation,Like classname="{{title}}"</p>
