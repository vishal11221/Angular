    Interview-Questions:- 
   1. How we call the API and Display the API value ? 
      First we create a service then Call http in service then import http module in module.ts file and create url and function in service.ts and call that function in component.ts

   2.What is API and Why we use it ?
     API is the mechanism that allow two software to  communicate with each other.Like one side we have Angular and another side we have database,so we directly not connect to angular to the database we need backend language or API to communicate with server.
